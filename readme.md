### A python script to solve TextTwist puzzles
##### Adam R. Rivers

This python script solves TextTwist puzzles using the 26 character roman alphabet.
It has the option of saving a pickle file of the dictionary.

The word dictionary for TextTwist1 is included in the file `tt1dict.txt`. 
I have not found the official dictionary for TextTwist2. If you need a more complete 
dictionary and you are a Mac or Linux user you can use the built-in word files:  
` /usr/share/dict/words` or `/usr/dict/words`
