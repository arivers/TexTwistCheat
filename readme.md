### A python script to solve TextTwist puzzles
### Adam R. rivrs

This python script solves Texttwist puzzles using the 26 character roman alphabet.
Is has the option of saving a pickle file of the dictionary.

The word dictionary for TextTwist 1 is included in the file `tt1dict.txt`  
I have not found the official dictionary for TextTwist2. If you need a more complete 
dictionary and you are a Mac or linux user you can user the built in word files:  
` /usr/share/dict/words` or `/usr/dict/words`
